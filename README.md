# Markowitz Reference Implementation

This repository accompanies the paper \cite{X}.
It contains a reference implementation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization
problem and the data used in the paper. Please note that the tickers of the
stocks have been obfuscated to comply with the data provider's terms of use.

## Experiments

Please run all experiments using

```bash
make experiments
```

Before the experiments start the virtual environment defined in 'requirements.txt'
is replicated locally.
